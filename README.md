### Description

This is the final project for the Odin Project's ReactJS course. It is a Twitter clone. It is a single page application that allows users to create an account, log in, and post tweets. It also allows users to see other people's tweets with a feed. The project is by far the biggest I have ever done and by designing everything from CSS to components to scripting by myself, it took a very long time. The backend used is Firebase which was a challenge in itself to learn and to integrate that with the front-end. In the end, I am very happy with the result and I learned a lot. I had to stop working on it due to time constraints as I had to move forward (everything took much longer than expected). For now, the "Tweet Button" and "Create Account" buttons are not working as I simply did not have time. The Anon login, google login and tweetbox from the feed however work.

The plan is to come back to this later and implement more features.
